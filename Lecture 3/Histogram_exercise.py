# Objective: Create a histogram that plots the 'length' field
# from the Abalone dataset (../data/abalone.csv).
# Set the range from 0 to 1, with a bin size of 0.02
######

# Perform imports here:
import pandas as pd
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go
# create a DataFrame from the .csv file:
df = pd.read_csv('abalone.csv')

# create a data variable:
data = [go.Histogram(x=df['length'],
                     xbins=dict(start=0, end=1, size=0.2))]
# add a layout
layout = go.Layout(title='Histogram Exercise')

# create a fig from data & layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
pyo.plot(fig)
